<br />
<br />
The researcher wants to prove the population mean of weight of the cabbage head is heavier than 2.5 (kg). State the null and alternative hypothesis. Perform the hypothesis test and make your decision based on comparing p-value to 0.05:  <br/>

Null: head is less than or equal to 2.5
Alt: The population mean weight of the cabbage is heavier than 2.5 kg
We fail to reject. The population mean of the cabbage head is not greater than 2.5

We are 95% confident that the difference is between 0.197 and 1.056

The researcher wants to show mean of weight of the c39 cabbage head is different from the mean of weight of the c52 cabbage head. State the null and alternative hypotheses. Perform the hypothesis test and make your decision based on comparing p-value to 0.05:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/sZO6uBS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Project walk-through"/>
<br />
<p align="left">
Check for equal variance. Less than 2 and more than 0.5.
If not equal then var.equal = F
Null: mean weight of c39 – c52 is equal to zero
Alt: mean weight of c39 – c52 is not equal to zero
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/aXYq4mC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Project walk-through"/>
<br />
Reject the null. The mean weight of the c39 head is not equal to the mean weight of the c59 cabbage head.

We want to check whether the ascorbic acids content (VitC) of cabbages for three different planting dates are different. State the null and alternative hypotheses and then perform one-way ANOVA. If necessary, perform Tukey’s Honestly Differences Test:  <br/>

Null: all equal
Alt: at least one is not equal

<br />
Reject the null as at least one is less than the significance level and both lwr and upr are positive or negative.
